Are you looking for inspiration for a future digital publishing project? We've asked the MuPuDIG community to crowdsource a database of digital projects that they've participated in or been inspired by, to serve as a shared resource.

* Check out our growing [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C0-14eQ58y9KM02no9VvPwzmvVXFEESjypZmFZA4wCY/edit?usp=sharing) of digital publications to see what's happening in the field.
* And if you're aware of a cool project, please [contribute](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKK2mwSG9fpMgAFoE5qkjKvYUQK7U4596QikNxBB3mE9-ODQ/viewform) to the list!
