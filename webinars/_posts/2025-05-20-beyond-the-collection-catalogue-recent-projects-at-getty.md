Following a handful of early digital publishing experiments, Getty began publishing open access books online in 2016 and has just published their twentieth open access title. During that time, they also released their multiformat publishing tool, Quire, under a free, open source license for other museums and institutions to use. While both Quire and Getty's digital publishing program started with a focus on museum collection catalogues and multi-author proceedings volumes, recent projects have begun to push those boundaries in interesting and productive new ways. Join Greg Albers, Gettyâ€™s digital publications manager, for a look at their most recent work and some things yet to come.
