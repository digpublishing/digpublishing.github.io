This webinar focuses on online journals. Or in other words, what it’s like to publish a book over and over again, every year, forever. Hear and learn about this daunting task from the intrepid and dedicated editors and staff of four art history journals: Isabel Taube and Petra Chu from *[Nineteenth-Century Art Worldwide](https://www.19thc-artworldwide.org/)*; Meredith Martin and Hannah Williams from *[Journal18](https://www.journal18.org/)*; Doris Chon, Lauren Gendler, and Maureen Winter from [G*etty Research Journal*](https://www.19thc-artworldwide.org/); and Jessica Skwire Routhier from *[Panorama](https://journalpanorama.org/)*.

First, with an introduction by each of the four journals represented, we’ll learn the nuts and bolts of their operations including their editorial focus and frequency, staff size, and readership stats. We’ll then dive into a panel discussion and ask them about their most effective marketing strategies, biggest lessons learned, proudest moments, and those things they keep meaning to get around to, but just haven’t.
